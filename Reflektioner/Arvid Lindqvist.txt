Ingenj√∂rsdagbok...

First uppdate to enginnering diary.
We started of by making a github repository for the project. 
We decided to use python as the language and started of with the foundation for the projeckt that Mikael made in python.

I decided to use the github desktop aplication learnt the basics and cloned the project to my computer. Since the projekt
is suposed to run in containers we use docker and figuring thart out was rather more dificult. I ended upp folowing the 
tutorial that apears in the docker aplication witch i think was a good tutorials. And i managed to get the kitchenview 
and burgerorderer to run in their containers. Throuh this i learnt how to build container images and run them in docker.

We also meet in person and discuss the projeckt and distribute the work between us. In our github repo we have also set upp 
all the folders and files for the projeckt. There is also two branches one called "Development" And "Main". 
I have so far made a few comits to the repo. I fixed the html in burgerorderer so now you can order a burger and it gets 
printed out in the console of kitchenview. But mainly i have been trying to understand flask and figure out how evrything 
works.
