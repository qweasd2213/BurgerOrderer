Ingenj√∂rsdagbok...

First uppdate to enginnering diary.
We started of by making a github repository for the project. 
We decided to use python as the language and started of with the foundation for the projeckt that Mikael made in python.

I decided to use the github desktop aplication learnt the basics and cloned the project to my computer. Since the projekt
is suposed to run in containers we use docker and figuring thart out was rather more dificult. I ended upp folowing the 
tutorial that apears in the docker aplication witch i think was a good tutorials. And i managed to get the kitchenview 
and burgerorderer to run in their containers. Throuh this i learnt how to build container images and run them in docker.

We also meet in person and discuss the projeckt and distribute the work between us. In our github repo we have also set upp 
all the folders and files for the projeckt. There is also two branches one called "Development" And "Main". 
I have so far made a few comits to the repo. I fixed the html in burgerorderer so now you can order a burger and it gets 
printed out in the console of kitchenview. But mainly i have been trying to understand flask and figure out how evrything 
works. 

Second uppdate to enginnering diary.
Since the last uppdate to the diary i have made commits to the burgerorderer.yaml and menuestore dockerfile, 
i added menuestore to burgerorderer.yaml so menuestore gets set up in its docker contaioner. I also corrected port number 
in menuestore docerfile. The group also met in person where we mainly tryed and figure out how to set upp the database, with 
litele succes. Ialso made commits to burgerorderer app.py and kitchenview app.py, for burgerorderer i added functionality for
selecting options and quantety for your burger. And uppdated kitchenview to handele options and quantety. I chose to add another 
page to burgerorderer after selecting burger where the user can chose potions and how many to buy and a button to send the order.
