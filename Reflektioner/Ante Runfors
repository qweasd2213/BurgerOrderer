First day:
Downloaded git to the terminal -> struggled finding the correct website for it - but i managed after some searching.
The group chose to use GITHUB as our distributor.
Made a SSH-key and connected it to GITHUB.

-Cloned the repository and made my first commit

Second day:
Sat in groups and made up a plan, each member decided of one of the hamburgers contents.

Third day:
Git didn't work. For some reason the SSH-key wasn't correct.
Had to make a new SSH-key, made a RSA-key first, which didn't work.
After some troubleshooting I made a new SSH-key (Ed25519), which did work.
Accidentally almost uploaded the private key to Github but thankfully GITHUB didn't accept it and told me to upload the public key.

Also tried downloading git-desktop becuase that's what my group uses, but since the SSH-key wasn't correct that didn't work either. After fixing the SSH-issues I decided to keep using GIT through the terminal.

-Removed the repo (hadn't made any changes and got confused on why git wouldn't work)
-Cloned the repo (once I had fixed the SSH-issues)
-Made a new commit.

I've also found useful git-commands:
    -git commit -m "message" (adds a commit to my local repo)
    -git push (pushes the local commit to github)


Fourth day:
I've researched automatic testing in Python - realised to late that the video only talked about testing to code and not the functions :D

Fifth day (14/10-24):
I think I misunderstood the assignment, after talking to some classmates and group members I think I'll need to make automatic testing for both the code and the answer. How I should proceed now is quite unclear, but I think I'll find something out after browsing the web. I'll find out more later today.

Plans:
Look at how DBWEBB validates the code.
Search for more information online about automatic testing.

-Added quite a bit to the journal, because I forgot to do it earlier. Will start with dates now as well.

2nd commit (14/10-24):

-Found out that you need to write "git add [file]" before you write 'git commit -m "[message]"'  and that once you've done that you can write "git push" to push it to the server (github)

I've also found two books that I'll read in the future, hopefully during this course but I probably wont have enough time for that.

Books:
    https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 - Book on how to use git
    http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/ - Book for automatic testing (which from what I've read is really important)
