First update
We have made a GitHub repository. We have also chosen to use python as our language for the assignment.
We have divided the work among each other. I was chosen to do the code for the burgerorder container. So far I've made some small commits but nothing major as I am trying to understand how I am supposed to do this. I have been reading through the presentations and watching some videos about the topic. I think I might be on the right track but I might need some help from the other group members as well.
All the members in the group are using GitHub desktop instead of the GitHub website. GitHub desktop makes it easier to use the commit, push and pull commands that I have been using. commit and push to send my changes to the other group members and pull to get the other members changes on my computer.

Second update
Translated the planering.md document to English from Swedish. I have also added new information about how we will work after we are done with our tasks. After one member is done with their tasks they will help the other members with their tasks. Used commit and push git commands to send it
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Third update
I have added more options in burgerorderer, added a options document in planering  that contains the options for all the burgers. Also removed the text from the individual burger documents so it does not contain useless information. Continued writing in the planering document. Used commit and push git commands to send it
The group meet up to work together with the project. As a group we tried to figure out how to work with the database and automated testing part of the project. We had no to little success but Ante and Hugo that are in charge with those parts will study it more over the weekend.

Fourth update:
I started this days work session with taking on the task to write the programs README. In the README i wrote about how the user should setup the program.
I did some research about if we should use burgerorderer.yaml or makefile to setup the program.
After looking around for a bit i saw that the makefile does the same thing as burgerorderer.yaml so I went with that. After that i did research about how to use the makefile, all that you need to do to use makefile is run the "make" command in the terminal. 
I tried to run this command with no success. I looked in to it and it turns out i need to have make installed on my computer. In order to install make i ran the commands sudo apt-get update and
sudo apt-get install build-essential. These commands installed make along with other essential development tools. Now when i ran the make command it worked, the program was built in Docker and i could run the program through Docker. 
After the README was done i did a commit and pushed it to our GitHub Desktop. I then helped the other group members with their tasks a little. I did some research about databases and automated testing, I also helped Leon out with the joint reflections.

Fifth update:
Continued helping out the other members with their tasks. I helped Leon with the join reflections for the most part. After that i did some research about how a debugging session should be done.
What should be tested, how to document it during the debugging and describe how the different buttons do when debugging such as "Continue”, “Step over”,
“Step into”, and “Step out”.
We continued to work on the join reflections as a group finishing up the documents. 
I have created a new venv so i can run the database. 
Did a debugging session and documented the session with the results and my thought about debugging as a tool.

Debug-session:  
For my Debugging session i chose to debug Burgerorderer specifically how it renders the front page.
I placed a breakpoint on line 57 in app.py in burgerorderer, under the function renderFrontpage. 
The usage of breakpoints allow me to examine the state of the program as well as the values of variables.
The breakpoints also allow me to control the flow which the program is executed, by using "Continue”, “Step over”,
“Step into”, and “Step out” im able to navigate through the program step by step.
Buttons in the debugger:
Step into: Used to go into a function on that line that you are currently on.
Step out: Used to execute the function that you are in at the moment and returns to the line were that function is called on.
Step over: Used to execute the line that you are on and steps into the next without going deeper into a function that you may be at.
continue: Used to execute the program like normal. Continues to do this until you hit another breakpoint in your code.

Debugging process:
I started with pressing "f5" to start the debug. which starts the debug at the breakpoint in line 57 in burgerorderer. 
Here i can see the variables curet values to the left in the variables menu. Which at the moment are none. 
As i step in to the function the variables pg gets the value '<h1> Welcome to BrugerOrderer</h1>' making Welcome to BUrgerOrderer a headline
When i continue to step into the function the pg variables is given <UL> that is used to create a list of the following burgers.
Continuing stepping into the program it uses the getburgers function to get the burgers from the database. 
In the for loop b is given the value of each burger in the database and adds the burgers to the list in the pg variable. 
I continue to use step into until b has been given every burger name and added them to the pg variables list. 
After the for loop is done the function adds </UL> the pg variable that ends the list of burgers for the front page. 
After i step into the last line for the renderFrontpage function the complete front page is returned 
For the last step into the function renderFrontpage is given to a new function called frontpage. This function loads the front page at the front page route '/'

Debugging session thoughts: 
The debugging session went well since i debugged a rather small function it didn't take that long to step through the function.
The variables values were easy to follow as they changed values through out the function. 
There were some difficulties when I was going to start the debug session. I found it a little difficult to figure out were i should place my breakpoint in the code.
But after looking in to it and trying different break point positions I got a good result that worked out in the end. 
It was also my first time debugging in visual studio code, I usually do my debugging through Thonny. So it took some time to figure out how to get it done. 
Debugging will definitely be a useful tool for me in the future. It is a very useful tool to go through your code and see exactly were the code runs in to an error or were it crashes.
