Wrote on our group reflection and added more about what went good in this project, what didn't go well but we still succeeded with and what we didn't get solved.

I also collaborated on fixing automatic testing. We did this by watching two different videos which gave us a broader view on the testing subject. We decided to either choose unittesting or pytesting. we decided to use Py testing which was the one i didn't watch but since they are similar i still helped.
