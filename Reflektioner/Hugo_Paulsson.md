## Planering
Today I've written a plan for the team. This plan included what each person is supposed to do. We haven't planed when things are supposed to be done. Everyone has their own main objectives, we have decided that you can do other things to so you don't have to work on only the main objective.
## MenuStore
We decided that my main objective is to work with MenuStore. I've decided to work with MySQL. I sadly missed yesterdays lecture so I read the pdf and have been trying to understand how SQL and RDBMS works. Haven't really understood evertyhing yet, I will use the internet to understand more about SQL and Database Management. 

**Information about our planing and To-DO list is in our repository. BurgerOrderer/Planering/planering.md**
