configuration management is a process which is used for controlling, tracking and handling changes in the program.

Our work with configuration management have been the tracking of features and handling changes on GitHub desktop.

The work flow most commonly used in this course from what we have seen is GitHub desktop. some of the GitHub commands used are pull, push and branches feature. Pull is used to get the most recently pushed data which makes collaborating a lot easier. Push is what you do when you want to add something to the project and you push it so other people can see the thing you added. The branches makes the dividing between undeveloped features and finished features easier so you can track what is done and what is not.

The things that went well were the tracking of commits and work progress. We could easily track every members commits and work progress through out the project using GitHub desktop.

The things that also went well were when we committed changes it was easy to see since you need to add a description to what the changes you add to the project, which made it easy to be up to date with the most recent changes and with what is going on with the project.

The problem that occurred was that one of our members didn't want to use GitHub desktop and used the terminal, and when he thought he merged locally he merged to the server instead which created some issues and since the other members use GitHub desktop we didn't know how to fix it and had to look for information to fix it but in the end we managed to succeed in restoring it.

We managed to solve every problem which occurred in the work progress quite easily.
